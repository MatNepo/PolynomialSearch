## Objective
The main goal of this project is to determine the coefficients of a polynomial based on measurement results for input and output signals. The polynomial should approximate the given data within the error bounds caused by measurement inaccuracies.

## Input Data
The input data consists of measured values of \( x \) and corresponding \( y \) values in matrix form. 

```matlab
x = [

2.7897 
2.9809

```

## Program Structure
The program is structured in the following way:

1. **Mathematical Expectation Calculation**:
   - Computes the average values of \( y \).
   
2. **Variance Calculation**:
   - Calculates the variances of \( y \).
   
3. **Cochran's Hypothesis Testing**:
   - Verifies if the measurements are consistent using Cochran's criterion.
   
4. **Method Selection for Data Processing**:
   - Chooses the appropriate method based on the hypothesis testing results.
   
5. **Coefficient Determination**:
   - Determines the coefficients of the polynomial that best fits the data.
   
6. **Error Characteristic Estimation**:
   - Evaluates the error characteristics of the measurement device based on the derived polynomial.

## Usage
To use this program, run the provided MATLAB scripts in the following order:

1. `Polynomial.m`: Main script to perform polynomial fitting and error analysis.
2. `final.m`: Finalizes the computations and provides the output.
3. `si.m` and `yAverage.m`: Supporting scripts for intermediate calculations.

### Example
To run the main script, use the following command in MATLAB:
```matlab
run('Polynomial.m')
```

## Results
The program outputs the polynomial equation that best fits the provided data along with various statistical analyses and error estimates. An example output is:

```plaintext
y = 29.4829 + 0.0408 * x^1
```

The output includes the average values of \( y \), variances, and detailed statistical metrics including Cochran's and Fisher's criteria results.
